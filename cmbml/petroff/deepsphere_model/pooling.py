"""Healpix Sampling's Pooling and Unpooling
The pooling divides the number of nsides by 2 each time.
This represents (in the term of classic pooling kernel sizes) a division (pooling) or multiplication (unpooling) of the number of pixels by 4.
The kernel size for all modules is hence fixed.

Sampling theory from:
*HEALPix — a Framework for High Resolution Discretization, and Fast Analysis of Data Distributed on the Sphere* by Gorski (doi: 10.1086/427976)

Figure 1 for relation number of sides and number of pixels and for unpooling using tile.
The area of the pixels are the same hence latitude and longitude of the resolution are the same.

The lowest resolution possible with the HEALPix base partitioning of the sphere surface into 12 equal sized pixels
See: https://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/

:math:`N_{pixels} = 12 * N_{sides}^2`
Nsides is the number of divisions from the baseline of 12 equal sized pixels
