# Format of this config:
#  - The pipeline is a sequence of stages
#  - The top-level key is the name of a stage (string) in the pipeline
#  - Each stage is a dictionary with the following keys:
#    - assets_out: dictionary of assets produced by this stage
#       - Each asset_out is a key-value pair
#         - The key (string) is the name of the asset
#         - The value (dictionary) contains the following (for now, one key):
#           - fn (the string "fn"): name (string) of file to store the asset
#    - assets_in: dictionary of assets required by this stage
#       - Each asset_in is a key-value pair
#         - The key (string) is the name of the asset
#         - The value (dictionary) contains the following (for now, one):
#           - stage (the string "stage"): name (string) of stage that produced the asset
#           - The value MUST appear as a stage name preceding the current stage!
#              - e.g. preprocess can only use "raw" and "make_normalization"
#    - splits: list of splits to process
#      - Each split is a string
#    - dir_name (string): name of the directory to store the assets 
#  - The first stage should be "raw" (not simulation)
