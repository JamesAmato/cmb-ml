# Note that this config has placeholders commented out.
# PYTHON section are variables set in the Python code, generally from other hydra configs
# GLOBAL PYILC: nothing noteworthy
# CHOICES, ALL METHODS: for beam_type and bandpass_type, an option must be chosen
#                       some options mean that other parameters need to be set.
# OPTIONAL, ALL METHODS: this is a small selection of parameters which can be set
# UNIQUE: The choice of Harmonic / Gaussian Needlet / Cosine Needlet is set here
#         with wavelet_type. Other parameters follow, which are particular to that method


# In case specific parameters are found which need to be set algorithmically in this python repo
#         need to choose a particular config_maker.
# Currently unused; TODO Remove this!
