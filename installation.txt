- Clone the repositories (both ml_cmb_pysm_sims and the dependency, pysm3).
    - Either (git with HTTPS)
    - `git clone https://github.com/JamesAmato/ml_cmb_pysm_sims.git`
    - `git clone https://github.com/galsci/pysm.git`
    - Or (git with SSH):
    - git clone git@github.com:JamesAmato/ml_cmb_pysm_sims.git
    - git clone git@github.com:galsci/pysm.git

- Create and activate a conda environment
    - `conda create --name ml_cmb_pysm_sims python=3.8`
    - `conda activate ml_cmb_pysm_sims`

- Install healpy using conda (consider skipping this at first; it may only be needed on a Mac; unknown currently.)
    - At least on a mac (maybe? apparently?), healpy doesn't like the pip installer but is ok with the conda installer. Maybe.
    - I'm not sure the correct process; some combination of
    - Official healpy documentation says the following, but this adds conda-forge to your channels permanently:
    - `conda config --add channels conda-forge`
    - `conda install healpy`
    - Instead, I suggest `conda install -c conda-forge healpy` which makes no system-wide changes.

- Try to install all of pysm3 with pip
     - Within the repo, install using `pip install .`
     - That may fail for healpy, but install everything else except pysm3 itself
     - Then do `pip install --no-deps .`

- Still missing numba and toml
    - Run `conda install numba toml tqdm`

Then:  install other dependencies, whatever
