Cache should go here if your `local_system` configuration matches this suggested directory structure.

These files are created when running this code. While the codebase is in flux, it is recommended to generate them every time you update the repo (either delete everything in the Cache or use the `force_new_noise_cache` parameter in the top level config.yaml). 

This file is a placeholder, to ensure git creates the directory.

The code should not run if the cache parent directory is missing, to ensure data is going to the intended location.
