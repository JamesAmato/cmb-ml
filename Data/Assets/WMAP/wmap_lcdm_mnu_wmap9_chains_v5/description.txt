The files in this directory are created by concatenating 6 independent chains.
For each chain, we ignore the first 100 points, and include the rest.
The first point is identical for each of the chains, and the next 99
points are also deleted, before concatenation.
When the job was stopped abruptly, we sometimes discard points
at the end of the chain too, if not all files were fully flushed to disk.

From chain1:
  We use a total of 100386 points, after removing the first 100.
  These are going into lines 1 through 100386 of the concatenated chain files.
From chain2:
  We use a total of 100714 points, after removing the first 100.
  These are going into lines 100387 through 201100 of the concatenated chain files.
From chain3:
  We use a total of 100513 points, after removing the first 100.
  These are going into lines 201101 through 301613 of the concatenated chain files.
From chain4:
  We use a total of 101017 points, after removing the first 100.
  These are going into lines 301614 through 402630 of the concatenated chain files.
From chain5:
  We use a total of 101057 points, after removing the first 100.
  These are going into lines 402631 through 503687 of the concatenated chain files.
From chain6:
  We use a total of 100249 points, after removing the first 100.
  These are going into lines 503688 through 603936 of the concatenated chain files.
