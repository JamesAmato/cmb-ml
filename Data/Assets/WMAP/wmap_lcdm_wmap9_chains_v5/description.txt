The files in this directory are created by concatenating 6 independent chains.
For each chain, we ignore the first 100 points, and include the rest.
The first point is identical for each of the chains, and the next 99
points are also deleted, before concatenation.
When the job was stopped abruptly, we sometimes discard points
at the end of the chain too, if not all files were fully flushed to disk.

From chain1:
  We use a total of 216217 points, after removing the first 100.
  These are going into lines 1 through 216217 of the concatenated chain files.
From chain2:
  We use a total of 215792 points, after removing the first 100.
  These are going into lines 216218 through 432009 of the concatenated chain files.
From chain3:
  We use a total of 215354 points, after removing the first 100.
  These are going into lines 432010 through 647363 of the concatenated chain files.
From chain4:
  We use a total of 216490 points, after removing the first 100.
  These are going into lines 647364 through 863853 of the concatenated chain files.
From chain5:
  We use a total of 216186 points, after removing the first 100.
  These are going into lines 863854 through 1080039 of the concatenated chain files.
